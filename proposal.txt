For our data set we chose the Swiss government's opendata.swiss database. This data base contains information on every aspect of Swiss government and life. Our current plan is to combine several data sets, including data on the disposable income/savings of the populace and the spending of the government. Having such a wide reaching data set will allow us to design a visualization that makes insightful and meaningful conclusions about the state of affairs in Switzerland over a ~20 year period. There are many possible lines of inquiry that we could examine in this dataset; our first course of action will involve paring down these options and finding the trends and connections that result in the most interesting and valuable conclusions. Our current plan involves framing these various conclusions from the central vantage point of fiscal spending, which provides a natural way to connect elements such as education rates and poverty rates. 
	
As our data is spread heavily across different time periods while also being heavily tied to the geography of Switzerland, our visualization will be heavily influenced by these characteristics. We intend on having a map-based visualization (likely using folium or something similar) while also making use of interactivity to make comparison between years easy. As there’s a lot of different features we’re hoping to splice together, we anticipate that it might be challenging to consolidate them into a visualization that’s easy on the eyes. This will likely prove to be an interesting challenge, though, and will force us to make use of good visualization practices.
